California Aid is a fictional financial aid database
created for Cal State University Bakersfield's CMPS3420 "Database Systems" course. 
This code is my own implementation for the final phase of the course. 
Attached will also be a pdf containing phases 1-4, which were created
throughout the semester. 
This project is currently connected to an Oracle Database on our university server. 
The front-end is created using Django.
